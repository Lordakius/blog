Hej there!

I am a computer scientist, living in Berlin, Germany. I work in IT forensics but also 
enjoy dabbling with hardware and other "tech stuff". This blog has two objectives: firstly, I want to vent 
about things that annoy me and maybe also get you to dislike the same things ;) 
But I also want to use it to procrastinate my usual stuff with funny things and document
them here. So, get yourself something nice to drink and enjoy the stay. 

If you want to contact me about anything, you can do so at 
[blog@soeyler.com](mailto:blog@soeyler.com).
